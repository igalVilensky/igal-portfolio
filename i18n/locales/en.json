    "title": "Hey, I'm Igal!",
    "me": "Nice to meet you",
    "subtitle": "I’m a full-stack developer with a knack for improvisation, a love for creating tools that make life easier, and a colorful life story that spans continents and stages. Based in Leipzig, Germany, I blend code with creativity to build apps that people love to use.",
    "personalTitle": "A Bit About Me",
    "personalDesc1": "My journey in tech started in 2019, when I moved from Israel to Germany, just as I was about to dive into a dev course back home. By 2020, I was studying web development in Leipzig, and I haven’t looked back since. I love building things that make people’s lives easier—whether it’s a sleek SaaS platform or a responsive web app. I’ve worked on projects like Flowplace, where I crafted features with Vue.js and Directus, and LeanERA, where I helped transition a startup to a product-focused company with scalable codebases. At ARI Motors, I built user-friendly interfaces for a comparison portal for electric vehicles, making complex info feel simple and accessible.",
    "personalDesc2": "Before coding, I was in the startup world at Myfxbook and Cashdo in Israel, managing web and social media channels with a creative flair. But my life’s been anything but ordinary. I spent a year and a half in Russia’s far north, Yamalo-Nenets, braving -60°C winters. Oh, and did I mention I was an actor? From TV series and films to commercials and even the Israeli opera (no singing, just acting!), I’ve always loved telling stories—now I do it through code.",
    "personalDesc3": "Outside the tech world, I’m a dad who cherishes time with my kids, a piano player who improvises melodies, and a curious soul studying Kabbalah to explore life’s deeper meanings. Leipzig’s my home now, where I enjoy cozy cafés and the occasional hike, though I’ll admit travel’s lost a bit of its spark lately. I approach life like I approach coding: with curiosity, adaptability, and a touch of improvisation.",
